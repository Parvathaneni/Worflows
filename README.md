# Enterprise DevOps Metrics Framework

This repository provides a structured approach to managing and scaling DevOps metrics across multiple Lines of Business (LOBs) such as BI, DE, PI, and Corporate Technology. The goal is to enable centralized visibility while preserving flexibility for team-specific requirements.

---

## Goals

- Establish a reusable, scalable framework for metrics collection and visualization.
- Promote collaboration between platform and LOB teams through shared standards.
- Maintain clear separation between shared logic and custom LOB-specific requirements.

## Folder Descriptions

### `lob-shared/`

Contains standardized, reusable metric logic across all LOBs. Teams are encouraged to contribute here if a metric pattern applies across departments.

**Examples:**
- `app-id/`: Common logic for extracting and mapping application identifiers.
- `repo-topics/`: Logic to assess repository metadata (CI/CD presence, ownership, tagging).
- `technology/`: Technology stack metrics (e.g., Terraform usage, SonarQube results).

Use for:
- Shared queries and filters.
- Reusable dashboards or templates.
- Metrics tied to enterprise-wide standards.

---

### `lob-specific/`

Contains metric customizations, filters, or dashboards specific to each line of business. These can extend or override logic from `lob-shared/`.

**Examples:**
- `bi/`: Business Intelligence-specific filters and dashboards.
- `de/`: Data Engineering job-specific metrics.
- `pi/`: Platform Infrastructure-specific infrastructure usage and compliance metrics.

**Recommended Structure for Each LOB:**



Use for:
- Business/team-specific KPIs or dashboards.
- Custom tag extraction rules or naming conventions.
- Data that does not apply to other LOBs.

---

## Integration Guidance

- Metrics should support validation through CI/CD pipelines.
- Data should be exportable to Power BI, Grafana, or Datadog.
- File formats may include `.yml`, `.json`, `.sql`, or `.pbix` (Power BI).
- Logic in `lob-shared/` should be generic and non-breaking.

---

## Best Practices

- Follow a modular approach: shared where possible, custom only where needed.
- Use consistent naming conventions and folder layout.
- Each subfolder should contain a short `README.md` or metadata file.
- When updating shared logic, use versioning to avoid breaking dependencies.
- Document changes clearly in Pull Requests.

## Change Management

To ensure stability and traceability, the following rules apply when making changes:

| Change Type                  | Affected Folder     | Review Required? | Responsible Team         |
|-----------------------------|---------------------|------------------|---------------------------|
| New LOB Customization       | `lob-specific/`     | No               | LOB Team                  |
| New Shared Logic            | `lob-shared/`       | Yes              | Platform Team             |
| Modification to Shared Logic| `lob-shared/`       | Yes              | Platform Team             |
| Deleting Shared Logic       | `lob-shared/`       | Yes              | Platform Team + LOB Reps  |
| Major Schema Refactoring    | `lob-shared/`       | Yes              | Platform Team             |
| Folder Structure Change     | Any                 | Yes              | Repo Maintainers          |

> All updates to shared logic (`lob-shared/`) must go through a Pull Request and be reviewed by the Platform Team and any impacted LOBs.
